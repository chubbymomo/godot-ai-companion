# godot-ai-companion# Godot AI Companion

A powerful tool designed to help Godot developers leverage AI assistance by intelligently exporting and organizing their project files. This tool creates AI-friendly documentation of your Godot project, making it easier to get meaningful help from AI assistants.

## Features

- üìÅ Smart project organization and chunking
- üìä Detailed project statistics and summaries
- üéØ Focused exports for specific directories
- üìù Comprehensive file categorization
- üîÑ Incremental updates support
- üõ°Ô∏è Binary file handling
- üìà Memory-efficient processing

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/godot-ai-companion.git
```

2. Navigate to the src directory:
```powershell
cd godot-ai-companion/src
```

3. Run the script in your Godot project directory:
```powershell
.\GodotProjectConcatenator.ps1
```

## Requirements

- PowerShell 5.1 or higher
- Write permissions in your Godot project directory
- Sufficient disk space for exports

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```powershell
.\GodotProjectConcatenator.ps1
```

### Advanced Options
```powershell
.\GodotProjectConcatenator.ps1 -OutputMode "summary" -MaxChunkSize 1MB -FocusPath "scripts"
```

### Parameters

- `-OutputMode`: Type of export ('full', 'summary', 'incremental')
- `-MaxChunkSize`: Maximum chunk size (1KB to 10MB)
- `-FocusPath`: Specific directory to focus on
- `-IncludeStats`: Include detailed statistics

## Output Structure

The script generates several files:

1. Main structure file (`project_structure_[date].txt`)
2. Summary file (`project_summary_[date].txt`)
3. Content chunks (`chunk_[number].txt`)
4. Export manifest (`export_manifest.json`)

## Best Practices

### For AI Assistance
- Start with the summary file for context
- Reference specific chunks when discussing code
- Use focus paths for specific problems
- Include relevant category information

### For Large Projects
- Use summary mode first
- Focus on specific directories when needed
- Adjust chunk size based on needs
- Use incremental mode for updates
